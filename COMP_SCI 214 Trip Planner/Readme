I implement a trip planning API that provides routing and searching services, by implementing some of the most notable ADTs, data structures, and algorithms we learned in COMP_SCI 214. Some of the most notable features include:

- ADTs: Dictionary, WUGraph, Priority Queue
- Data Structures: Hash Table, Adjacency Matrix, Binary Heap
- Algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Heap Sort
